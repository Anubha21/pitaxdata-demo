===================================================================

This repository was established for the World-Bank-sponsored training
sessions that began during September 2018 in New Delhi at the Tax
Policy Research Unit (TPRU) in the Ministry of Finance.  The training
sessions extended through June 2019.  This repository, which is called
`taxdata` and is owned by the GitHub organizaton called `TPRU-India`,
is now managed by TPRU.

The data files produced here are suitable for use in a tax
